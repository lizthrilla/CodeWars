// Your task is to complete the Cat class which Extends Animal, we want to go to use the original speak method as well, so you must use the super method so the speak method for Cat now returns e.g.

class Animal { 
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  speak() {
    return this.name + ' makes a noise, ';
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    return super.speak() + this.name + ' goes meow.';
  }
}
